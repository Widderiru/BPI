\section*{Question2}
The process is built up like in the picture. First I selected the attributes I
am assumed to consider (\textbf{Select Attributes}). Then the numerical values
are translated to binomial values, because this is needed for the association
rules. (\textbf{Numerical to Binomial}) RapidMiner expectes a FrequentItemSet
for the \textbf{Create Association Rule}, so before I could use that I also had
to use \textbf{FP-growth}.

I would pick the rule \{A\_ACCEPTED, O\_ACCEPTED\} $\Rightarrow$	\{A\_APPROVED\}
and \{A\_APPROVED\} $\Rightarrow$	\{A\_ACCEPTED, O\_ACCEPTED\}, because they
have the highest lift, confidence and support. When you have a closer look you
will see that the sets are probably of the rules have a back- and forth
relationsip. Such that you can summarize it in one rule. Then you could look for
the next best rules, where lift, support and confidence is the highest.
