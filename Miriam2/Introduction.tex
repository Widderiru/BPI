\section{Introduction}
In this assignment I have to analyze for a fictional financial institute data and make suggestions 

\section{General insights about the data set}

The given data set is generated between 1st Oct 2011 0:38:44 (Saturday) and 14th Mar 2012 16:04:54 (Wednesday) and contains 13087 cases with 262200 events executed. One case contains minimal 3 events and maximal 175. In average 20.035 events.

There are 4366 different variants of cases. There are 36 different events possible 
"W\_Complete\_Application + COMPLETE" (9.141\%), "W\_Complete\_Application + START" (8.967\%), "W\_Quotations + COMPLETE" (8.763\%), "W\_Quotations + START" (8.545\%), "App\_Fully\_Submission + COMPLETE" (4.991\%), "App\_Incomplete\_Submission + COMPLETE" (4.991\%), "W\_Handeling\_Incomplete\_Dossiers + COMPLETE" (4.35\%), "W\_Handeling\_Incomplete\_Dossiers + START" (4.348\%), "W\_Validation + COMPLETE" (3.011\%), "W\_Validation + START" (3.01\%), "App\_Rejection + COMPLETE" (2.912\%), "W\_Complete\_Application + SCHEDULE" (2.811\%), "App\_Pre\_Acceptation + COMPLETE" (2.81\%), "P\_Initiation + COMPLETE" (2.681\%), "P\_Selection + COMPLETE" (2.681\%), "P\_Sending + COMPLETE" (2.681\%), "W\_Quotations + SCHEDULE" (2.53\%), "W\_Handling\_Leads + COMPLETE" (2.249\%), "W\_Handling\_Leads + START" (2.249\%), "App\_Acceptation + COMPLETE" (1.95\%), "W\_Validation + SCHEDULE" (1.916\%), "App\_Finalization + COMPLETE" (1.913\%), "W\_Handling\_Leads + SCHEDULE" (1.82\%), "P\_Cancellation + COMPLETE" (1.394\%), "P\_Returning + COMPLETE" (1.317\%), "App\_Cancellation + COMPLETE" (1.071\%), "W\_Handeling\_Incomplete\_Dossiers + SCHEDULE" (0.909\%), "App\_Initiation + COMPLETE" (0.857\%), "App\_Approving + COMPLETE" (0.857\%), "App\_Registration + COMPLETE" (0.857\%), "P\_Acceptation + COMPLETE" (0.855\%), "P\_Rejection + COMPLETE" (0.306\%), "W\_Fraud\_Detection + COMPLETE" (0.103\%), "W\_Fraud\_Detection + START" (0.103\%), "W\_Fraud\_Detection + SCHEDULE" (0.047\%) and "W\_Changing\_Contact\_Details + SCHEDULE" (0.005\%).

The complete, start and shedule are more details about the state of the event. Just about the Workflow events we have more information about the state. 

All processes start in "App\_Fully\_Submission + COMPLETE" (100.0\%).

The processes can end in 13 different events:

"App\_Rejection + COMPLETE" (26.202\%), "W\_Validation + COMPLETE" (20.975\%), "W\_Handling\_Leads + COMPLETE" (17.07\%), "W\_Complete\_Application + COMPLETE" (14.816\%), "W\_Quotations + COMPLETE" (9.849\%), "App\_Cancellation + COMPLETE" (5.005\%), "W\_Handeling\_Incomplete\_Dossiers + COMPLETE" (3.454\%), "P\_Cancellation + COMPLETE" (2.132\%), "W\_Fraud\_Detection + COMPLETE" (0.436\%), "W\_Changing\_Contact\_Details + SCHEDULE" (0.031\%), "W\_Validation + START" (0.015\%), "App\_Registration + COMPLETE" (0.008\%) and "W\_Quotations + START" (0.008\%).

Having a look at the whole data it can be seen, that there are just athe following events executes: "W\_Complete\_Application", "W\_Handling\_Leads", "App\_Incomplete\_Submission", "P\_Cancellation", "App\_Fully\_Submission" and "App\_Rejection". Furthermore is there a constant input of new cases. The events are mostly during the week executed same amount of times just "W\_Fraud\_Detection" and "W\_Changing\_Contact\_Details" have really deeps and ups. What is not surprising, because both are outlier behavior actions.
