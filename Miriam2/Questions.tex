\section*{Questions}
% 1. Are some decisions in any of the models driven by the applicationâ€™s amount?
% 2. Are there clear indications that the same employees are always involved in cases that are
% declined, approved or cancelled?
% 3. The process owner would like to see a comparison of the throughput times between the nonapproved
% applications, i.e. those cancelled or rejected by the applicant, and the approved
% applications. In particular, he/she is interested in the time between the moment in which an
% application is submitted and when it is approved, compared with the time between the
% application is submitted and it is rejected or cancelled.
