\section{Conclusion}
Recapping all results from the last parts I would say, that there a few points throughout the event, where it could be done better. There are 2 big bottlenecks in the process, which should be optimzied. Also the use of the resources could be optimized. The difference between the fastest trace is much faster than the slowest one, which should be analyzed in more detail for all process parts.
