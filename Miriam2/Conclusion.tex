\section{Conclusion}

Recapping all results from the last parts I would say, that there a few points throughout the process, where it could be done better. There are 2 big bottlenecks in the process, which should be optimzied. Also the use of the resources could be optimized. For example could the workload be distributed better, such that everyone is doing close to the same amount of work for the steps.  The difference between the fastest trace is much than the slowest one is really big, which should be analyzed in more detail for all process parts. But because of a lack of information about the details of the events and the process it is hard to give real recommedations. It is known, which persons are just working halftime or fulltime? Are there people, that just can do special tasks or are there tasks, that need special training?
